Hi there and welcome to my profile. 
A little about me. My name is Peter.
 I am 30 years old and currently live in wakefield with my wife, Louise. 
 I was born in Seacroft, Leeds but moved to Wakefield in 2010.
 I first began learning code with a company called Coding Institute where I took a 5 day coding challenge 
 and found a new hobby in coding.
